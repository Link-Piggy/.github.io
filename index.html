             <h1>Hello Candidate</h1>
             <h2>This is the page I made for the students who didn't get good grades at the national college entrance exam.</h2>
             <h3>First, let me ask you a queation. What do you think is the purpose of education?</h3>
             <p>like this? <img src="https://i.zgjm.org/top/20190523/2186-1.jpg" class="small" id="smart-image"></p>
             <p>Some people think it is getting into a good university, others think it is getting a good job. All of these are true. In general, education is about developing a wide range of abilities, but passing exams is definitely not the purpose of education.</p>
             <p>From my limited experience, when you enter the workplace, people look for your thinking skills, communication skills and teamwork.</p>
             <p>Please don't keep getting caught up in your emotions, go and do something that engages with society, you will find a big world and lots of opportunities. There is much more to life than just the high school entrance exam.</p>
